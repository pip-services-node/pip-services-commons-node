/**
 * Interface for creating sets of component references, which have the ability to add new references, 
 * find reference using locators, or remove reference from the set.
 * 
 * Used as part of the inversion of control design pattern, specifically - inversion of dependency.
 * 
 * In PipServices, the "location design pattern‚Äù is used, which is much simpler than dependency injection.
 * It is simple to implement and portable between languages. Used for building various containers, as well as 
 * for testing objects.
